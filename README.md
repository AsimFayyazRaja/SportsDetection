# SportsDetection
Given a picture of sports, it tells which sports is this.

## Usage
* Add folders named "wwe", "basketball", "football", "cricket" to train the model.
* Add a test folder named "test" having test images.
* Execute "sports.py" to train model and test it. After training model will be saved in "/model/"

## Datset
- I couldn't find a dataset so generate my own by playing videos on youtube and running "ss.js"
- "ss.js" takes screenshots and saves in any directory you wish so in about 2-3 hours I got a pretty decent dataset.

## Development
- Python3
- Tflearn
- Tensorflow

## License
- It is a free tool and anyone can use it.
